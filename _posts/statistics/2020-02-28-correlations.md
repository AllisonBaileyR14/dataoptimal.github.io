## Environmental Survey Analysis

In 2017, UCSB-Bren PhD candidate, Alexander DeGolia, published his dissertation "Choosing Green: Explaining Motivations Across Different Environmental Behaviors".[1] Part of the research included an extensive survey to California residence to evaluate motivations that drive support or opposition towards environmental policies and programs. The data collected on each residence was broken down into age, gender, education level, income level, and political affiliation.  Each resident was asked their level of support (Strongly Oppose, Mostly Oppose, Neutral, Mostly Support, Strongly Support) for three California environmental programs: Cap and Trade, Land Conservation, and Renewable Energy. 

A Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to evaluate the variables in the survey that were most correlated with the levels of support for the Land Conservation Program.
