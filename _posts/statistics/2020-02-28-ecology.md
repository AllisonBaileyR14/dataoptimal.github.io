## Growth Rate and Population Density Analysis

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/solar.jpg">

There are two types of population growth in the environment. The first is exponential growth, where there resources are unlimited (density-independent growth).  The second is logistical growth, where resources are limited (density-dependent growth). 

To project annual population growth rate with population density data, you can use the formula *ln Nt - ln No/t = r* which also remember that r = dN/Ndt.

Reminder:
Nt = No e^rt where Nt = population size at time t; No = original population size, r = intrinsic rate of increase and t = time

The graph below visualizes the population density and growth rate for specified countries:

Below is a multiple linear regression of the effect of education levels and caloric intake on population growth rate:

After running a multiple linear regression below, it was found that caloric intake does not play a critical role in a population's growth rate.  For this reason, I will conduct further analysis of daily caloric intake and years of education separately. 

The graph below visualizes the population density and growth rate for Argentina and China. The red dots reflect the carrying capacity (K) for each country:

Below is a multiple linear regression on the effect of caloric intake on population growth rate:

Caloric intake does not play a critical role in a population's growth rate.  This was also confirmed through an AIC test, where it was proven that education level is a more significant variable to determine growth rate. Furthermore, the findings on the multilinear regression model found the coefficient value of calories to be 0.

After analyzing the data through multiple linear regression to explore relationships between dN/Ndt (a continuous outcome variable) and the predictor variable of education level and country described below:

•	dN/Ndt - a continuous quantitative variable

•	Education Level - a categorical variable with 12 levels

•	Country - a categorical variable with 5 levels

Running multiple linear regression, we find the following regression equation:

dN/Ndt(Education Level, Country) = 1.380e-02 - 1.020e-03(years_ed) +  1.704e-03(Canada) - -2.040e-03(China) - 2.247e-03(India) + 4.544e-03(Kenya).

Further interpretations of each coefficient:

* -1.020e-03(years_ed): If everything else is held constant, we would expect a 1.020e-03 decrease in dN/Ndt for each level of increase in education level.

* 1.704e-03(Canada): If everything else about the variables is the same (education level), we would expect Canada dN/Ndt to be 1.704e-03 higher than the average.

* -2.040e-03(China): If everything else about the variables is the same (education level), we would expect China dN/Ndt to be - 2.040e-03 lower than the average.

* -2.247e-03(India): If everything else about the variables is the same (education level), we would expect India dN/Ndt to be - 2.247e-03 lower than the average.

* 4.544e-03(Kenya): If everything else about the variables is the same (education level), we would expect Kenya dN/Ndt to be 4.544e-03 higher than the average.

GDP does not play a critical role in a population's growth rate.  This was also confirmed through an AIC test, where it was proven that education level is a more significant variable to determine growth rate.

Here is the reproducible code:

# Now let's do PCA. Use the 'prcomp()' function
# land_pca <- prcomp(land_clean, scale = TRUE) gives us error!

# We have errors.  Let's explore missingness!

summary(land_clean)

# Let's drop that one NA using drop_NA()

# Now let's try our PCA again....

# Now we are ready to plot our PCA..
