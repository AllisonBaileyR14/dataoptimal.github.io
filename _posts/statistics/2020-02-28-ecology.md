## Growth Rate and Population Density Analysis

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/solar.jpg">

There are two types of population growth in the environment. The first is exponential growth, where there resources are unlimited (density-independent growth).  The second is logistical growth, where resources are limited (density-dependent growth). 

To project annual population growth rate with population density data, you can use the formula *ln Nt - ln No/t = r* which also remember that r = dN/Ndt.

Reminder:
Nt = No e^rt where Nt = population size at time t; No = original population size, r = intrinsic rate of increase and t = time

The graph below visualizes the population density and growth rate for specified countries:

The graph below visualizes the population density and growth rate for Argentina and China. The red dots reflect the carrying capacity (K) for each country:

The graph visualizes the socioeconomic variable of caloric intake (daily Kcal) and its effects on growth rate:

Here is the R Markdown document to how these graphs and statistical analysis was produced:

Here is the reproducible code:
```r
# Attach libraries to be able to conduct Q. 2 on the assignment (PCA)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(naniar)
library(VIM)
library(skimr)
library(ggfortify)
library(here)

# Read in the data.
land_conservation <- read_csv("DeGoliaSurvey_PSETXLS.csv")

land_clean <- land_conservation %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(-captrade, -renewables)
  
# Now let's do PCA. Use the 'prcomp()' function
# land_pca <- prcomp(land_clean, scale = TRUE) gives us error!

# We have errors.  Let's explore missingness!

summary(land_clean)
# There is 1 NA in the income column
# double check with gg_miss_var
gg_miss_var(land_clean)

# Let's drop that one NA using drop_NA()

land_ready <- land_clean %>%
  drop_na()

# Now let's try our PCA again....
land_pca <- prcomp(land_ready, scale = TRUE)

# Now we are ready to plot our PCA..

land_biplot <- autoplot(land_pca,
                      colour = NA,
                      loadings.label = TRUE,
                      loadings.label.size = 3,
                      loadings.label.colour = "black",
                      loading.label.repel = TRUE) +
  ggtitle("Land Conservation: Support Level Correlations") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

land_biplot
