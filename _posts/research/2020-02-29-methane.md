## Methane Oxidation in Landfills

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/methane.jpg">

The United States generates an average of 250 million tons of organic municipal waste (MSW) per year that is distributed to the nearest proximate landfill of the country's 3000 active landfills (EPA, 2018). Ensuing bovine manure and rice paddy agricultural practices, landfills are the third-largest generators of arguably the most significant greenhouse gas (GHG) affecting climate change; methane (CH4) (Abushammala, 2014).  The production of methane in landfills is exacerbated by pivotal shifts in key variables such as an increase in temperature, pH levels of the soil, and precipitation that contribute to perturbations in the biogeochemical phases (Malgorzata, 2006). Under optimal conditions, the process of methane oxidation can be concurrent with methanogenesis, resulting in methane emission mitigation. Due to the sensitivity of the methane oxidation process, researchers and leading experts are developing new technology to exploit the capabilities of methane oxidation to reduce methane emissions from landfills.

A Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to evaluate the variables in the survey that were most correlated with the levels of support for the Land Conservation Program.

As shown in the PCA results, education level and income were the biggest factor in Land Conservation support or opposition. 

Here is the R Markdown document to how these maps were produced:

Here is the reproducible code:
```r
# Attach libraries to be able to conduct Q. 2 on the assignment (PCA)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(naniar)
library(VIM)
library(skimr)
library(ggfortify)
library(here)

# Read in the data.
land_conservation <- read_csv("DeGoliaSurvey_PSETXLS.csv")

land_clean <- land_conservation %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(-captrade, -renewables)
  
# Now let's do PCA. Use the 'prcomp()' function
# land_pca <- prcomp(land_clean, scale = TRUE) gives us error!

# We have errors.  Let's explore missingness!

summary(land_clean)
# There is 1 NA in the income column
# double check with gg_miss_var
gg_miss_var(land_clean)

# Let's drop that one NA using drop_NA()

land_ready <- land_clean %>%
  drop_na()

# Now let's try our PCA again....
land_pca <- prcomp(land_ready, scale = TRUE)

# Now we are ready to plot our PCA..

land_biplot <- autoplot(land_pca,
                      colour = NA,
                      loadings.label = TRUE,
                      loadings.label.size = 3,
                      loadings.label.colour = "black",
                      loading.label.repel = TRUE) +
  ggtitle("Land Conservation: Support Level Correlations") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
