## Introduction

Specified contaminants compounded in fuel, known as Petroleum hydrocarbon (PHCs), are a common form of environmental pollution (Puntas, 2017). 
The leading cause of PHC pollution is caused by leaking underground fuel tanks (LUFTs).  Although not classified as a hazardous material by nature, 
LUFTs require immediate attention from state and federal agencies due to the negative environmental impact that can incur if left unmediated. PHCs 
negative effects include contamination of soil resulting in contaminated ground water or reduced utility of land for agriculture or other development 
purposes (CDC, 1999). For this reason, PHCs have been broken down by individual contaminants and classified as constituents of gasoline/fuel in order 
to further research contamination remediation as well as establish government protocols and regulations. Toluene, an identified contaminant within gasoline, 
is known to have biodegradable characteristics when introduced to microbial communities in soil and water. Biodegradation of Toluene is limited by volume 
and time, wherein high concentrations at the source of the spill can be toxic to microbial organisms.  Limitations of biodegradation of Toluene at the source 
of the spill further constrain biodegradation rates due to low-oxygen levels.  High Oxygen concentrations are incumbent for microbial aerobic biodegradation, 
as the Oxygen operates as terminal electron acceptors (TEA).  Furthermore, Toluene is classified as a volatile organic compound (VOC), which diffuses rapidly 
in the presence of air allowing for shorter lag time between spill and biodegradation.

Method

For this experiment, the biodegradation of Toluene was measured over time through Carbon mineralization. Toluene biodegradation will be observed through the 
inoculation of a toluene degrading bacterium (bioaugmentation), addition of nutrients, and toluene concentrations. Toluene biodegradation will be studied as 
a function of several treatments: inoculation with a toluene degrading bacterium (bioaugmentation), addition of nutrients, and two toluene concentrations.  
Toluene treatments were monitored over time.

Toluene concentration in the test bottle headspace will be monitored over time to assess the effect of treatments on the process.  Sterile controls will be 
from sterilized (autoclaved: 121C,1 hr; repeat 3 times with a few days in between) soil.  Below, is a breakdown of preparation steps:

1.	In each treatment bottle, weigh 10 g (ODE) of soil. NOTE: the soil is assumed to have a 20% moisture content (g water / g ODE soil), and so12 grams of 
moist soil was weighed into the bottle.

2.	In each sterile control, weigh 10 g of (ODE) sterile soil: NOTE: use aseptic technique so that soil is not contaminated in the process.

3.	The inoculum solution was prepared by suspending a generous loop (flame-sterilized) of P. putida into 10 mL of sterile ½ 21C nutrient solution in a 15 mL 
blue capped tube.  The bottle was capped and vortexed to mix pellet completely.

4.	5 mL of nutrients, water or P. putida suspension was added per treatment specifications (see table below).  All bottles were placed on a roller to mix completely.

5.	Using the gas tight syringes, the toluene was then transferred through the Mininert caps into the bottles to result in aqueous phase concentrations of 
100 mg/L (Low/8.7 L) or 200 mg/L (High/17 L). Note: When toluene is added to a closed bottle with soil and soil water, the toluene will distribute between 
the gas phase and the aqueous phase, reaching equilibrium. We determined how much toluene to add to have a desired aqueous phase concentration, by calculating 
the distribution of toluene mass at equilibrium. This is called performing a mass balance. Review appendix 1 for mass balance calculations.

6.	15 minutes on a roller was allowed for complete equilibration. The bottles were then incubated at room temperature (25 C) in the dark. It is important to 
note that simulating a nocturnal environment assists in limiting photodegradation of the Toluene to ensure unadulterated results of biodegradation from the various 
treatments (Marques, 2016). 

7.	At 15 minutes (t=0) and at intervals thereafter, the toluene concentration in each bottle was measured in the headspace using a gas chromatograph.

As shown in the PCA results, education level and income were the biggest factor in Land Conservation support or opposition. 

Here is the R Markdown document to how these maps were produced:

Here is the reproducible code:
```r
# Attach libraries to be able to conduct Q. 2 on the assignment (PCA)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(naniar)
library(VIM)
library(skimr)
library(ggfortify)
library(here)

# Read in the data.
land_conservation <- read_csv("DeGoliaSurvey_PSETXLS.csv")

land_clean <- land_conservation %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(-captrade, -renewables)
  
# Now let's do PCA. Use the 'prcomp()' function
# land_pca <- prcomp(land_clean, scale = TRUE) gives us error!

# We have errors.  Let's explore missingness!

summary(land_clean)
# There is 1 NA in the income column
# double check with gg_miss_var
gg_miss_var(land_clean)

# Let's drop that one NA using drop_NA()

land_ready <- land_clean %>%
  drop_na()

# Now let's try our PCA again....
land_pca <- prcomp(land_ready, scale = TRUE)

# Now we are ready to plot our PCA..

land_biplot <- autoplot(land_pca,
