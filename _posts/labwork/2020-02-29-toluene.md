## Introduction

Specified contaminants compounded in fuel, known as Petroleum hydrocarbon (PHCs), are a common form of environmental pollution (Puntas, 2017). The leading cause of PHC pollution is caused by leaking underground fuel tanks (LUFTs).  Although not classified as a hazardous material by nature, LUFTs require immediate attention from state and federal agencies due to the negative environmental impact that can incur if left unmediated. PHCs negative effects include contamination of soil resulting in contaminated ground water or reduced utility of land for agriculture or other development purposes (CDC, 1999). For this reason, PHCs have been broken down by individual contaminants and classified as constituents of gasoline/fuel in order 
to further research contamination remediation as well as establish government protocols and regulations. Toluene, an identified contaminant within gasoline, is known to have biodegradable characteristics when introduced to microbial communities in soil and water. Biodegradation of Toluene is limited by volume 
and time, wherein high concentrations at the source of the spill can be toxic to microbial organisms.  Limitations of biodegradation of Toluene at the source  of the spill further constrain biodegradation rates due to low-oxygen levels.  High Oxygen concentrations are incumbent for microbial aerobic biodegradation, as the Oxygen operates as terminal electron acceptors (TEA).  Furthermore, Toluene is classified as a volatile organic compound (VOC), which diffuses rapidly in the presence of air allowing for shorter lag time between spill and biodegradation.

## Methods

For methods, please review the full lab report embedded below. 

## Results 

The results were taken only for the high peak area and ran through the calculations below.  To see the final calculations of all treatments see appendix 2 of the full lab report embedded below. 

$$M_toluene=(Peak Area)/9653*  (Density of Toluene)/(Molecular Weight of Toluene)*1000 mL/L$$

The Toluene biodegradation within the sterile soil control treatments held an extended lag time and inequivocally slow biodegradation rates. When comparing the controls to the healthy soil, there is a stark contrast in the biodegradaton rates. Furthermore, treatments with the healthy soil had infinitesminal lag times. There is minor differences in each of the healthy soil treatments depicted.  For further scrutiny, a magnified view of the Toluene Treatment Levels is presented in the next section displayed below.

An in-depth review of each Toluene Treatment infers differences between the controls where the added nutrients held a greater biodegradation of 5 mol/L of Toluene and remained consistent in it’s rate of biodegradation in comparison with the control water treatment. The P. Putida + Nutrients Treatment had the highest rate of biodegradation of Toluene which appears to have occurred immediately upon Toluene exposure to the treatment. The ½ 21C Mineral Media had the second highest biodegradation rate, followed by the water treatment. It appears all three of the heatlhy soils + bioaugmentation had minimal, if any, lag time in the biodegradation process. 

## Discussion

Due to the curvature kinetics of the treatments represented in the graphs depicted above, it is inferred that the reactions are following the integrated rate law of 1st order. For a zero-order rate to occur, a successive half-life must be present wherein the half-life decreases by a factor of two. Zero order rate would also mean the rate of biodegradation is independent of the concentration of the Toluene.  Therefore, it is unlikely that the treatment rates are zero-order due to concentration levels of Toluene being significant to microbial biodegradation. It is possible to presume that the kinetic rate is 1st order due to the nature of the curved slope remaining relatively constant (Vallance, 2017).  To prove this hypothesis, we use the integrated rate law for First Order kinetics which is applied in the graph to the left.  The integrated rate law formula is as follows:

$$ln⁡(Concentration of Toluene)= -kt+ln⁡(Initial concentration of Toluene)$$

The purpose of the sterile controls was to emphasize differentiation in Toluene biodegradation when bioaugmentation and/or healthy soil is present. As noted in the results, Toluene biodegradation is severely limited under sterile conditions regardless if H2O or nutrient additives are introduced. The sterile controls assist in the evaluation of biodegradation in healthy soil conditions and variant degrees of bioaugmentation.

Aforementioned in the results section, there is a substantial difference in the biodegradation of Toluene between sterile soils and purportedly healthy soils. Further evaluation of the healthy soil treatments distinguished bioaugmentation as increasing microbial biodegradation.  The p. putida treatment was determined to have the highest rate of Toluene biodegradation.  However, both the nutrient and H2O treatment were competitive in rates of biodegradation to the p. putida treatment.  What can be inferred from this experiment is that there is significant value in healthy soil and its promotion of biodegradation. Although the experiment results are useful in theoretical principles, the experiment did not account for seasonal fluctuations of temperature, Ph levels in the soil, nor diurnal environments that affect Toluene biodegradation.
