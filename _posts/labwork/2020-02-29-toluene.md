## Introduction

Specified contaminants compounded in fuel, known as Petroleum hydrocarbon (PHCs), are a common form of environmental pollution (Puntas, 2017). The leading cause of PHC pollution is caused by leaking underground fuel tanks (LUFTs).  Although not classified as a hazardous material by nature, LUFTs require immediate attention from state and federal agencies due to the negative environmental impact that can incur if left unmediated. PHCs negative effects include contamination of soil resulting in contaminated ground water or reduced utility of land for agriculture or other development purposes (CDC, 1999). For this reason, PHCs have been broken down by individual contaminants and classified as constituents of gasoline/fuel in order 
to further research contamination remediation as well as establish government protocols and regulations. Toluene, an identified contaminant within gasoline, is known to have biodegradable characteristics when introduced to microbial communities in soil and water. Biodegradation of Toluene is limited by volume 
and time, wherein high concentrations at the source of the spill can be toxic to microbial organisms.  Limitations of biodegradation of Toluene at the source  of the spill further constrain biodegradation rates due to low-oxygen levels.  High Oxygen concentrations are incumbent for microbial aerobic biodegradation, as the Oxygen operates as terminal electron acceptors (TEA).  Furthermore, Toluene is classified as a volatile organic compound (VOC), which diffuses rapidly in the presence of air allowing for shorter lag time between spill and biodegradation.

As shown in the PCA results, education level and income were the biggest factor in Land Conservation support or opposition. 

Here is the R Markdown document to how these maps were produced:

Here is the reproducible code:
```r
# Attach libraries to be able to conduct Q. 2 on the assignment (PCA)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(naniar)
library(VIM)
library(skimr)
library(ggfortify)
library(here)

# Read in the data.
land_conservation <- read_csv("DeGoliaSurvey_PSETXLS.csv")

land_clean <- land_conservation %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(-captrade, -renewables)
  
# Now let's do PCA. Use the 'prcomp()' function
# land_pca <- prcomp(land_clean, scale = TRUE) gives us error!

# We have errors.  Let's explore missingness!

summary(land_clean)
# There is 1 NA in the income column
# double check with gg_miss_var
gg_miss_var(land_clean)

# Let's drop that one NA using drop_NA()

land_ready <- land_clean %>%
  drop_na()

# Now let's try our PCA again....
land_pca <- prcomp(land_ready, scale = TRUE)

# Now we are ready to plot our PCA..

land_biplot <- autoplot(land_pca,
                      colour = NA,
                      loadings.label = TRUE,
                      loadings.label.size = 3,
                      loadings.label.colour = "black",
                      loading.label.repel = TRUE) +
  ggtitle("Land Conservation: Support Level Correlations") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

land_biplot
